# multiassistant

Simple app to manage multiple Home assistants.

## Installation

Release builds are available on the [releases page]()
You can also build the app yourself by cloning this repository and running `flutter build apk` or `flutter build ios` in the root directory.

## Usage

The app is pretty simple to use. You can add as many Home assistants as you want. You can also add a name to each Home assistant. You specify the local address of the Home Assistant instance and the external address. 

The application opens the WebView of the instance page. There is no way to send phone sensors to the instance.

At this point, the non-connection to the instance occurs only through the external address.


## To do
- Load the application from the local address (if it responds)
